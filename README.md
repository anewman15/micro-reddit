# Micro-Reddit

In this micro-project, I created models for a backend similar to Reddit in order to exercise Active Record validation, migration and associations for Users, Posts and Comments. All the data were created and queried using the Rails console.

## Built With

* Ruby v 2.7.1

* Rails v 6.0.3.3

* SQLite3


## Deployment

* Clone this repo from [here](https://github.com/anewman15/micro-reddit/)

* Open your terminal and run `bundle install`
* Run `rails console` and `Hirb.enable` to enter the console
* Run the following queries:
- `User.all` to get all the users present in the database
- `Post.all` to get all the posts in the database
- `Comment.all` to get all the comments in the database

* Run the query `User.first.posts` and notice it returns the posts created by the user with `id = 1`
* Similarly, `Post.first.user` will give you the info about the author of the first post
* Run `Comment.first.user` will return the user who created the first comment in the database
* You can create more complex queries like `Post.first.user.comments` which returns all the comments made by the author of the first post in the database, and `Comment.find(3).user.comments` to find all the comments made by a commenter.
